# 100 Days of Hacking Challenge - Day 1 🚩

## 📜 Topic: Fundamentals of Ethical Hacking & Computer Networks

**Date:** December 29, 2025  
**Focus:** Introduction to Cyber Security, Hacking Methodologies, and Network Basics.

## 🧠 Overview
Day 1 focused on laying the theoretical foundation required for cybersecurity. I explored the differences between Ethical Hacking and Bug Bounty hunting, debunked common myths, and started diving into the architecture of the internet (Networks and Servers).

## 📚 Key Learnings

### 1. Ethical Hacking vs. Bug Bounty
* **Ethical Hacking:** A broad field involving authorized probing of systems to fix security flaws.
* **Bug Bounty Hunting:** A crowdsourced model where hackers are paid "per vulnerability" found (e.g., via HackerOne).
* **Penetration Testing:** A professional service where a company hires a hacker for a specific scope and time (Pay-per-service).

### 2. Common Myths
| Myth ❌ | Reality ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| You need to be a math genius. | You need logic & persistence. Math is mostly for crypto. |
| Hacking is always illegal. | Ethical Hacking is a legal, high-demand career. |
| It's just typing fast in a terminal. | 80% of the work is research and reconnaissance. |

### 3. The 5 Phases of Ethical Hacking
1.  **Reconnaissance:** Gathering info (IPs, Domains) passively.
2.  **Scanning:** Active probing for open ports and services.
3.  **Gaining Access:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter the system.
4.  **Maintaining Access:** Ensuring re-entry (often skipped in white-hat scenarios).
5.  **Clearing Tracks / Reporting:** Removing logs or, more importantly for ethical hackers, documenting the findings.

### 4. Types of Penetration Testing
* ⬛ **Black Box:** No prior knowledge of the target. Simulates an external attack.
* ⬜ **White Box:** Full access to source code and network maps.
* Yz **Gray Box:** Partial access (e.g., user-level credentials).

## 🌐 Networking Fundamentals

### Network Types (by Scale)
* **PAN:** Personal Area Network (Bluetooth).
* **LAN:** Local Area Network (Home/Office Wi-Fi).
* **MAN:** Metropolitan Area Network (City-wide).
* **WAN:** Wide Area Network (The Internet).

### The Client-Server Model
* **Client:** The requester (e.g., Browser).
* **Server:** The provider (e.g., Google's Data Center).
* **Communication:** Request ➡️ Response.

### Data Packets 📦
Data is broken into small chunks called **packets** to travel across the net.
* **Header:** Source & Destination IP.
* **Payload:** The actual data.
* **Trailer:** Error checking.

### Types of Servers
* **Web Server:** Hosts websites (HTTP/HTTPS).
* **DNS Server:** Translates URLs to IP addresses.
* **Mail Server:** Manages email traffic.
* **FTP Server:** For file transfers.
